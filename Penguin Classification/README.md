# Penguin Clasification Type

## Description
Simple app to predict penguin species. 

A Random Forest Classifier model was built beforehand and save it, so the streamlit app can read this model and make predicitions with it. By using this approach there's no need to rebuild the model everytime we want to make a prediction.

User input features options: 
* Upload file as csv
* Direclty input parameters in sidebar
